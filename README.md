In many student rooms, managing shared expenses still means scribbling on whiteboards, juggling receipts, or endlessly updating Excel files. It's **slow**, **prone to mistakes**, and worst of all – it **steals your time**.
## ❌ Before roomXepense:
- 📋 You tracked expenses with **manual sheets** – full of errors and disputes.
- 🧾 You had to **remind others** constantly – "Who paid for the last bill?"
- 📆 You wasted hours every month **figuring out who owes what**.

## ✅ After roomXpense:
- 🖥️ Everything is digital, transparent, and **real-time**.
- 📊 Every expense is logged and split **automatically**.
- 💡 No more confusion – just **clear records** and **happy roommates**.
